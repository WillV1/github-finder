## Description
  
This application utilizes Github API to allow users to run a search on Github users by username. I selected this project to complete to build proficiency is using React hooks and the Context API.  I originally coded the application using class components and then refactored using hooks and context. The primary issue I had was doing the refactor, as this was the first major application I built using hooks and context.
